Hello, I am Dr. Afif. In this video,
I welcome you all. In today’s video,

0:00:05.120,0:00:09.679
I will talk about an important topic,
and that is sexual health.

0:00:09.679,0:00:15.280
There are some common misconceptions in our society.
Many people feel scared or ashamed about this topic.

0:00:15.280,0:00:22.400
Some even fall victim to wrong treatments. So today,
we will dispel these misconceptions in the light of science.

0:00:22.400,0:00:27.760
Watch the video till the end and share it with your friends
because this information is necessary for everyone to know.

0:00:27.760,0:00:32.559
Talking about sexuality in our society is still
considered a taboo, which has led to many misconceptions spreading.

0:00:32.559,0:00:38.079
Many people come to me saying
they masturbate and fear that it will weaken their body.

0:00:38.079,0:00:43.120
Some try to test their sexual ability before marriage
and end up facing problems, thinking they have a permanent issue.

0:00:43.120,0:00:48.239
Others get alarmed after seeing misleading posters or advertisements
claiming "100% guaranteed treatment," but these

0:00:48.239,0:00:53.360
are often unscientific and harmful. Today, we will
clear these misconceptions and provide accurate information.

0:00:53.360,0:00:59.280
The first misconception is that masturbation weakens the body.
Many believe

0:00:59.280,0:01:05.199
that masturbation causes the body to weaken, reduces sexual strength,
or harms health. This is a misconception.

0:01:05.199,0:01:10.960
It doesn’t cause any loss of nutrients like vitamins or
minerals, so there’s no need to fear this.

0:01:10.960,0:01:16.400
Now, let’s move to the second misconception:
Semen is made from blood, and its release weakens the body.

0:01:16.400,0:01:21.280
There’s a common belief in our society that semen is made from blood,
so when it’s released, the body becomes weak.

0:01:21.280,0:01:27.759
But this is a misconception. Semen is produced in the reproductive system,
and its release has no connection to the body’s strength or health.

0:01:27.759,0:01:33.759
It’s a natural process. The next misconception is that
if a sticky substance comes out with urine, it’s harmful.

0:01:33.759,0:01:39.680
Many people get scared when they see a slippery or sticky substance
during urination or sexual arousal, thinking it’s semen or harmful.

0:01:39.680,0:01:46.640
In reality, this is a natural bodily process called pre-ejaculate.
It helps with lubrication and doesn’t harm the body.

0:01:46.640,0:01:51.040
The next misconception is that sexual ability depends on penis size.
Many believe

0:01:51.040,0:01:56.399
that sexual ability depends on the size or shape of the penis.
This is a misconception. Sexual satisfaction

0:01:56.399,0:02:01.040
actually depends on emotional connection, communication,
and mutual understanding with your partner.

0:02:01.040,0:02:06.719
Also, masturbation doesn’t make the penis smaller or thinner—
this is another baseless fear.

0:02:06.719,0:02:12.400
The next misconception is that wet dreams are a sign of illness.
Many feel ashamed or scared about wet dreams,

0:02:12.400,0:02:17.239
but it’s a natural occurrence, especially during puberty
and adulthood. It’s not a sign of disease or sexual weakness.

0:02:17.239,0:02:22.959
There’s no need to worry about it. Some men think
that if sexual intercourse lasts only a few minutes, they have a problem.

0:02:22.959,0:02:28.400
But an average duration of 3 to 5 minutes is normal for about 90% of people.
Sexual satisfaction doesn’t depend on time

0:02:28.400,0:02:33.440
but on mutual enjoyment and connection. Plus,
there are techniques to increase duration if needed.

0:02:33.440,0:02:39.519
Some men, before marriage, test their sexual ability with girlfriends
or sex workers and face problems, thinking it’s permanent.

0:02:39.519,0:02:45.360
But these issues are often due to mental stress or lack of experience.
With time and a calm mind, it improves.

0:02:45.360,0:02:50.400
There’s no need to test this before marriage.
Problems during the first sexual experience are common.

0:02:50.400,0:02:56.720
Now, let’s talk about misleading advertisements.
You might have seen posters claiming "100% guaranteed treatment."

0:02:56.720,0:03:02.560
These ads often scare people into trying unscientific treatments,
which can be extremely harmful to your health.

0:03:02.560,0:03:08.159
If you have any sexual health issues, always consult
a qualified, registered doctor. So, how can we lead a healthy sexual life?

0:03:08.159,0:03:13.680
First, stay stress-free. Mental stress or fear
can greatly affect your sexual health.

0:03:13.680,0:03:19.200
Second, talk openly with your partner—communication is very important.
Third, if there’s a problem, avoid unscientific treatments

0:03:19.200,0:03:23.599
and consult a registered doctor. Lastly,
learn about your body and overcome misconceptions to build confidence.
